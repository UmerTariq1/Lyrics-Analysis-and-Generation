# Lyrics-Analysis-and-Generation

This project was created by a group of four people: Bet√ºl, ChihYing Huang (Elsa), Samvit and Umer (names in alphabetical order), as part of our "Deep Learning in Literary Texts" course. Our objective was to analyze song lyrics from Genius.com, focusing on works by famous artists. 

To showcase a part of our we developed a website which is deployed here:
https://butt-umer-lyrics-project-4b0ba297d89f.herokuapp.com

Note: There is also a faster, local version of the music generator available in the sing folder under SongGenerator.ipynb. 
Linkin Park's Numb is used as an example and can be found in sing/numb_linkin_park.mp3.
