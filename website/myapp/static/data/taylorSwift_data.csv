Mine,country,Taylor Swift,2010,220461,{},"[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we are lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that has ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we are taking on the world together
And there has a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I am guarded
You say we will never make my parents' mistakes
[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that has ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that has ever been mine

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that has all I have ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I shall never leave you alone.""
[Chorus 2]
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it has like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that has ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that has ever been mine

I am so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how has your family?
I have not seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I am sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom am not nothing but missing you
Wishing I had realized what I had when you were mine
I had go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
[Verse 2]
These days, I have not been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I did not call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I am sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time

I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night

Probably mindless dreaming

Speak Now,country,Taylor Swift,2010,102730,{},"[Verse 1]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I shall meet you when you are out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""
[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you?)

Of the church, at the back door

Ooh, ooh

I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there has my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I am only looking at you

[Verse 3]

On a white veil occasion

 And he just might make me smile 
 But the whole time, I am wishing he was you instead

 Won't see you again

Teardrops On My Guitar,country,Taylor Swift,2006,140972,{},"[Verse 1]

Better Than Revenge,rock,Taylor Swift,2010,203194,{},"[Intro]
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone and let us hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, would not have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She has not a saint and she has not what you think
She has an actress, whoa
She has better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she has gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground will not make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it has a party and she has on the list
She looks at me like I am a trend and she has so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I am psycho because I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication is not what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they did not teach you that in prep school so it has up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She has not a saint and she has not what you think

Dear John,country,Taylor Swift,2010,332292,{},"[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor will not fall through... again
My mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you are gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should have known

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it has me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it has you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you shall add my name to your long list of traitors
Who do not understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""
[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you are gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?

[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you hav run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So do not look now
I am shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you are already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I had never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you hav never met

We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I am standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please do not go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I shall be waiting, all there has left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I shall be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, because we are dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

This love is difficult, but it has real
Don't be afraid, we will make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I do not know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said

 But I believe in whatever you do 
 And I shall do anything to see it through 
 Because these things will change 
 Can you feel it now? 
 These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down 
 This revolution, the time will come 
 For us to finally win 
 And we will sing hallelujah, we will sing hallelujah 
 Oh, oh 
 So we have been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered 
 It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair 
 We're getting stronger now, find things they never found 
 They might be bigger but we are faster and never scared 
 You can walk away, say we do not need this 
 But there has something in your eyes says we can beat this 
 'Cause these things will change 
 Can you feel it now? 
 These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down 
 This revolution, the time will come 
 For us to finally win 
 And we will sing hallelujah, we will sing hallelujah 
 Oh, oh 
 Tonight we stand, get off our knees 
 Fight for what we have worked for all these years 
 And the battle was long, it has the fight of our lives 
 But we will stand up champions tonight 
 It was the night things changed 
 Can you see it now? 
 These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down 
 It's a revolution, throw your hands up 
 'Cause we never gave in 
 And we will sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah 
 Hallelujah",Positive

I did not say half the things I wanted to

While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time

New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

Like diamonds in the sky

Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared

The Moment I Knew,country,Taylor Swift,2012,181122,{},"[Verse 1]
You should have been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I am right here"" smile
And it would have felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would have been so happy

[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I have got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I have been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you had be here
You said you had be here

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they are all laughing
As I am looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there has something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he had be here""

Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they are all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (Missing)

When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?

Is the one who did not show?

One last kiss, then catch your flight

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I do not feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you are halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still has not called
And then you feel so low you cannot feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you are here and it rains when you are gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""
[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I am not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I do not anymore

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still has not called
And then you feel so low you cannot feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""

It rains when you are here and it rains when you are gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

And my old faded blue jeans

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you were not here
To see me like that

And lookin' back on all of that, it has nice to believe

When we are on the phone and you talk real slow

 And you do not know what you do not know 
 Someday, I shall be living in a big old city 
 And all you are ever gonna be is mean 
 Someday, I shall be big enough so you cannot hit me 
 And all you are ever gonna be is mean 
 Why you gotta be so mean? 
 And I can see you years from now in a bar 
 Talking over a football game 
 With that same big loud opinion 
 But nobody's listening 
 Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things 
 Drunk and grumbling on about how I cannot sing 
 But all you are is mean 
 All you are is mean 
 And a liar 
 And pathetic 
 And alone in life 
 And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean 
 But someday, I shall be living in a big old city 
 And all you are ever gonna be is mean, yeah 
 Someday, I shall be big enough so you cannot hit me 
 And all you are ever gonna be is mean 
 Why you gotta be so mean? 
 Someday, I shall be living in a big old city 
 (Why you gotta be so mean?) 
 And all you are ever gonna be is mean 
 (Why you gotta be so mean?) 
 Someday, I shall be big enough so you cannot hit me

The Story of Us,country,Taylor Swift,2011,194028,{},"[Verse 1]
I used to think one day, we had tell the story of us
How we met, and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I am searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I do not even know what page you are on

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I cannot break through

[Chorus]
Now I am standing alone in a crowded room
And we are not speaking
And I am dying to know
Is it killing you like it has killing me?
Yeah, I do not know what to say
Since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you are doing your best to avoid me
I am starting to think one day, I shall tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I am scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I had tell you I miss you, but I do not know how
I have never heard silence quite this loud

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you had rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Never Grow Up,country,Taylor Swift,2010,102844,{},"[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it has so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you are dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I had give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh darling, do not you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, do not you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I will not let nobody hurt you, will not let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

[Verse 2]
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you are mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there has just so much you cannot do
And you cannot wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But do not make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she has getting older too
And do not lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school

Oh darling, do not you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little

And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs

In a big city, they just dropped me off

Last Kiss,country,Taylor Swift,2010,231017,{},"[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away

[Verse 2]
I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Chorus]
But now I shall go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I do not know how to be something you miss
I never thought we had have a last kiss
Never imagined we had end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
[Verse 3]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you are showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
I am not much for dancing
But for you I did

[Verse 4]
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you had kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I do not miss those rude interruptions

[Chorus]
And I shall go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I do not know how to be something you miss
I never thought we had have a last kiss
I never imagined we had end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh

[Bridge]
So I shall watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it has nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines
And it has a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind
[Chorus]
So I shall go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I do not know how to be something you miss
I never thought we had have a last kiss
Never imagined we had end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips
Just like our last kiss

I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

And bring on all the pretenders

I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines, wishing for right now

And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged

In ripped up jeans got to rule the world

Last Christmas,country,Taylor Swift,2007,18147,{},"[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I have been
But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again

[Chorus]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
[Verse 2]
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year

The Other Side Of The Door,country,Taylor Swift,2009,62139,{},"[Verse 1]
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said, ""This time I have had enough""
And you hav called a hundred times
But I am not picking up

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I am so mad I might tell you that it has over
But if you look a little closer

[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I am in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And do not you leave because I know
All I need is on the other side of the door
[Verse 2]
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

[Pre-Chorus]
So babe if you know everything
Tell me why you could not see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming, ""I am in love with you""
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And do not you leave because I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I shall scream out the window

I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?

This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I do not feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me

Now you are halfway out the door

And then you feel so low you cannot feel nothing at all

It rains when you are here and it rains when you are gone
I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

Here's to silence that cuts me to the core

Maybe I have been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside till I came out

I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie you had be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughing
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them

""Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you""
Not before I knew how much I had to lose

He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes
He'll never fall in love, he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
I’m laughing because I hope he has wrong
And I do not think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

I had lie

Innocently overlooks the truth

I do not let nobody see me wishin' he was mine

I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years""

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it has about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

""Come on, baby, with me

We'll just disappear

And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you will not grow into?

Sweet Tea and God’s Graces,country,Taylor Swift,2004,18083,{},"[Verse 1]
Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Wilson County creek
Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass
Baby, you were watching me
Cold barns, truck beds, everything you said
Slowly educating me

[Chorus]
You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And that has what I learned from you

Just like the two of us

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)

Nice to meet you, where you been?

You look like my next mistake

Screaming, crying, perfect storms

Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems

Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?
Ooh, did not it all seem new and exciting?

But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams, oh

 We both went mad

Struggled through the night with someone new

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

But no one heard a thing

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we are out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

Let them say what they want, we will not hear it

We wait for trains that just are not coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We play dumb, but we know exactly what we are doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom

I Know Places Voice Memo,pop,Taylor Swift,2014,41441,{},"So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end
How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that has why I am still so in love with song writing
So what I have done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways
So I shall explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together

I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder because I had always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time
So I always wanna be prepared
I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said ""I cannot stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else""
So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called ""I Know Places""
So this was the voice memo I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song

""Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:

Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i

Na na na na waiting at the back door
They're around and the vultures come around
And you know that they will not, they will not us
Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us
And you come and sing and listen
I would not think about it but I am not done
Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know some places we will not be found
And they shall be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places""

Or whatever
I do not know, but that has basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and it has about, like, everybody's, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and it has like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus

I Wish You Would Voice Memo,pop,Taylor Swift,2014,19437,{},"This is another way I have written songs recently

And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called ""I Wish You Would"", because Jack wrote back and said ""I love that""
So this is another way of writing, it has writing to track:

'Cause, baby, now we have got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (Uh)
So take a look what you hav done (Uh)
‘Cause, baby, now we have got bad blood (Uh), hey! (Hey!)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I cannot take it back, look where I am at (Uh)
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that? (Remember that?)
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I do not hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love do not hear no more
No, I do not fear no more
Better yet, respect am not quite sincere no more, ah!

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it has so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar]
'Cause, baby, now we have got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you hav done
'Cause, baby, now we have got bad blood, hey!
Now we have got problems
And I do not think we can solve 'em (Uh)
You made a really deep cut (Uh)
And, baby, now we have got bad blood, hey! (Hey!)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Remember when you tried to write me off? (Uh-huh)
Remember when you thought I had take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

Oh, it has so sad to
Think about the good times

Band-Aids do not fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go

If you love like that, blood runs cold

Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you are already flying through the freefall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I had never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you hav never met

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Oh, red

Tell myself it has time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Missing him was dark grey, all alone

1989 Liner Notes,misc,Taylor Swift,2014,40512,{},"Prologue""These songs were once about my life. They are now about yours.""

I was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on December 13, 1989.

In the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die. Our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world. And a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it. But lately I have been wondering... what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death? The moments when we are reborn...

The debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all I ever do is change. All I ever do is learn from my mistakes so I do not make the same ones again. Then I make new ones. I know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. Every day I wake up as someone slightly new. Isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new?

For the last few years, I have woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music. I needed to change the way I told my stories and the way they sounded. I listened to a lot of music from the decade in which I was born and I listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling. I was also writing a different storyline than I had ever told you before.

I wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city I had always been overwhelmed by... until now. I think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on New York and all its blaring truth. I wrote about the thrill I got when I finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse. I wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle. There is no ""riding off into the sunset,"" like I used to imagine. We are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something. I wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style. I wrote about an important lesson I learned recently... that people can say whatever they want about me, but they cannot make me lose my mind. I have learned how to shake things off.

I have told you my stories for years now. Some have been about coming of age. Some have been about coming undone. This is a story about coming into your own, and as a result... coming alive.

I hope you know that you hav given me the courage to change. I hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back do not define you. You are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for.

From the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to New York or find happiness in a world where she is not in love...

This night is sparkling, do not you let it go
I am wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I shall spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, do not you let it go
I am wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I shall spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

He said let us get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds
I thought heaven cannot help me now
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you shall remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you shall see me again even if it has just in your

And his voice is a familiar sound

He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we have had our very last kiss

 My one condition is 
 Say you shall remember me 
 Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe 
 Red lips and rosy cheeks 
 Say you shall see me again even if it has just in your 
 Wildest dreams (ah ah) 
 Wildest dreams (ah ah) 
 He said no one has to know what we do 
 His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room 
 And his voice is a familiar sound 
 Nothing lasts forever 
 But this is getting good now 
 He's so tall and handsome as hell 
 He's so bad but he does it so well 
 And when we have had our very last kiss 
 My last request is 
 Say you shall remember me 
 Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe 
 Red lips and rosy cheeks 
 Say you shall see me again even if it has just in your 
 Wildest dreams (ah ah) 
 Wildest dreams (ah ah) 
 Ooh 
 This night is sparkling 
 Don't you let it go, do not you let it go 
 This night is flawless 
 Don't you let it go, do not you let it go 
 This night is sparkling 
 Don't you let it go, do not you let it go 
 This night is flawless 
 Don't you let it go 
 You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night 
 Burning it down 
 Someday when you leave me 
 I bet these memories follow you around 
 You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night 
 Burning it down 
 Someday when you leave me 
 I bet these memories follow you around 
 You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night 
 Burning it down 
 Someday when you leave me 
 I bet these memories follow you around 
 You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night 
 Burning it down 
 Someday when you leave me 
 I bet these memories follow you around (follow you around) 
 Say you shall remember me 
 Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe 
 Red lips and rosy cheeks 
 Say you shall see me again, even if it has just pretend 
 Say you shall remember me 
 Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe

Sparks Fly Original Version,country,Taylor Swift,2007,33021,{},"[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I am a house of cards
You say my name for the first time, baby
And I fall in love in an empty bar
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you could not see what I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you are not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 2]
So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
I do not need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby
Bring on the movie score
'Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would
[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you are not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep your beautiful eyes on me
Gonna strike this match tonight
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I had love to hate it, but you make it like a firework show

Back to December / Apologize / You’re Not Sorry Live/2011,country,Taylor Swift,2011,62843,{},"[Verse 1]
I am so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me, how has your family
I have not seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I am sorry for that night
And I had go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I had realized what I had when you were mine
I had go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
[Verse 2]
These days I have not been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I did not call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall

[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came, the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I am sorry for that night
And I had go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I had realized what I had when you were mine
I had go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I had love you right
I had go back in time and change it, but I cannot

Red Liner Notes,misc,Taylor Swift,2012,46787,{},"ForewordThere's an old poem by Neruda that I have always been captivated by, and one of the lines in it has stuck with me ever since the first time I read it. It says ""love is so short, forgetting is so long."" It's a line I have related to in my saddest moments, when I needed to know someone else had felt that exact same way. And when we are trying to move on the moments we always go back to are not the mundane ones. They are the moments you saw sparks that were not really there, felt stars aligning without having any proof, saw your future before it happened, and then saw it slip away without any warning. These are moments of newfound hope, extreme joy, intense passion, wishful thinking, and in some cases, the unthinkable letdown. And in my mind, every one of these memories looks the same to me. I see all of these moments in bright, burning red.

My experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons, especially my experiences with crazy love. The red relationships. The ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and then hit a wall and exploded. And it was awful. And ridiculous. And desperate. And thrilling. And when the dust settled, it was something I’d never take back. Because there is something to be said for being young and needing someone so badly, you jump in head first without looking. And there has something to be learned from waiting all day for a train that has never coming. And there has something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that real love shines golden like starlight, and does not fade or spontaneously combust. Maybe I’ll write a whole album about that kind of love if I ever find it. but this album is about the other kinds of love that I’ve recently fallen in and out of. Love that was treacherous, sad, beautiful, and tragic. But most of all, this record is about love that was red.1. State Of Grace

Speak Now Liner Notes,misc,Taylor Swift,2010,44098,{},"Prologue'Speak now or forever hold your peace,' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world, right before the vows. It's a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyone's heart race, and a moment I have always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what they had kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens.

Real life is a funny thing, you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what I have begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything.

I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we did not speak up. When we did not say 'I love you.' When we should have said 'I am sorry.' When we did not stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help.

These songs are made up of words I didn’t say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December. To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak. To my band. To a mean man I used to be afraid of. To someone who made my world very dark for a while. To a girl who stole something of mine. To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world.

Words can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you’ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone.

What you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you’ll stutter and you’ll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest.

So say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you’ll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying ‘I could’ve, but it’s too late now.’

There is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it.

I do not think you should wait. I think you should speak now.

Love, Taylor

Hidden message: For you",2456617,en,2010,"Prologue'Speak now or forever hold your peace,' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world, right before the vows. It's a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyone's heart race, and a moment I have always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what they had kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens.  Real life is a funny thing, you know. In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what I have begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything.  I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we did not speak up. When we did not say 'I love you.' When we should have said 'I am sorry.' When we did not stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help.  These songs are made up of words I didn’t say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December. To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak. To my band. To a mean man I used to be afraid of. To someone who made my world very dark for a while. To a girl who stole something of mine. To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world.  Words can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you’ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone.  What you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you’ll stutter and you’ll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest.  So say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you’ll never send or in a book millions might read someday. I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying ‘I could’ve, but it’s too late now.’  There is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it.  I do not think you should wait. I think you should speak now.

It's just a cruel existence like it has no point hoping at all

Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

You All Over Me Taylors Version From the Vault,country,Taylor Swift,2021,315580,"{""Maren Morris""}","[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off, it has how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it has been spent and traded in
You cannot change where it has been, reminds me of me

I lived, and I learned, had you, got burned
Held out, and held on

Lost tears, swore that I had get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I have still got you all over me

Fearless Liner Notes,misc,Taylor Swift,2008,17777,{},"Taylor's Letter
This album is called ""Fearless"", and I guess I had like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, ""Fearless"" is not the absence of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you hav been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again...even though every time you'e tried before, you hav lost. It's fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you cannot breathe without them. I think it has fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he has in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they shall never stop doing, I think it has fearless to stop believing them. It's fearless to say ""you are NOT sorry"", and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless. Letting go is fearless. Then, moving on and being alright...That's fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after. That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless

And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they shall never stop doing, I think it has fearless to stop believing them. It's fearless to say ""you are NOT sorry"", and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless. Letting go is fearless. Then, moving on and being alright...That's fearless too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after. That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless   1.

 This album is called ""Fearless"", and I guess I had like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, ""Fearless"" is not the absence of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you hav been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen. Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again...even though every time you'e tried before, you hav lost. It's fearless to have faith that someday things will change. Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you cannot breathe without them. I think it has fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he has in love with someone else. And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they shall never stop doing, I think it has fearless to stop believing them. It's fearless to say ""you are NOT sorry"", and walk away. I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless. I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless. Letting go is fearless.

A Monster In My Closet,misc,Taylor Swift,2000,15294,{},"There's a monster in my closet and I do not know what to do!
Have you ever seen him?
Has he ever pounced on you?
I wonder what he looks like!
Is he purple with red eyes?
I wonder what he likes to eat.
What about his size!!
Tonight I am gonna catch him!
I shall set a real big trap!
Then I shall train him really well.
He'll answer when I clap!

When I looked up in that closet, there was nothing there but stuff.
I know that monster's in there!
I heard him huff and puff!
Could it be he wants to eat me?
Maybe I am his favorite tray.
And if he comes to get me,
I shall scream loudly, ""Go away!!""

Look What You Made Me Do,pop,Taylor Swift,2017,1761669,{},"[Verse 1]
I do not like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I do not like you
I do not like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I do not like you (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I have got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
[Verse 2]
I do not like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you shall all get yours

Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence

Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I do not want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
’Cause I do not want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I am not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I’m spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we are both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothin' about

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

I want your midnights
But I shall be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Getaway Car,pop,Taylor Swift,2017,822194,{},"[Intro]
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I did not mean it
And you didn’t see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin’, but we had never get far
Don't pretend it has such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I had be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car
[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you were not thinkin’
And I was just drinkin’
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin’, ""Go, go, go!""
But with three of us, honey, it has a sideshow
And a circus am not a love story
And now we are both sorry (We’re both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we had never get far
Don't pretend it has such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I had be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh

This am not for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We cannot make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
('Cause I like you)

Do the girls back home touch you like I do?

Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I am shaking my head and locking the gates

[Chorus]
This is why we cannot have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away

Did you think I would not hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we cannot have nice things

[Verse 2]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends do not try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But I am not the only friend you hav lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you were not so shady

 All the jokers dressing up as kings 
 They fade to nothing when I look at him 
 And I know I make the same mistakes every time

 I did one thing right 
 I am laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers 
 Trust him like a brother 
 Yeah, you know I did one thing right

 Chain 'round my neck

 But because he really knows me

 But would you run away with me?""

Dont Blame Me,pop,Taylor Swift,2017,824638,{},"[Intro]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy

Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I shall be usin' for the rest of my life

Reputation Prologue,misc,Taylor Swift,2017,191976,{},"Here's something I have learned about people.

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us. We know our friend in a certain light, but we do not know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.

This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we will meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.

The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I have been in the public eye since I was 15 years old. On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I have been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.

When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test. There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it has 2017 and if you did not see a picture of it, it could not have happened right?

Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...

If Youre Anything Like Me Poem,misc,Taylor Swift,2017,208920,{},"If you are anything like me,
You bite your nails,
And laugh when you are nervous.
You promise people the world,
because that has what they want from you.
You like giving them what they want...
But darling, you need to stop,

If you are anything like me,
You knock on wood every time you make plans.
You cross your fingers, hold your breath,
Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes
Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.
Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...
If life gets too good now,
Darling, it scares you.

If you are anything like me,
You never wanted to lock your door,
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer
Didn't want to face the you you do not know anymore
For fear she was much better before...
But Darling, now you have to.

There's a justice system in your head
For names you shall never speak again,
And you make your ruthless rulings.
Each new enemy turns to steel
They become the bars that confine you,
In your own little golden prison cell...
But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.

If you are anything like me
You've grown to hate your pride
To love your thighs
And no amount of friends at 25
Will fill the empty seats
At the lunch tables of your past
The teams that picked you last...
But Darling, you keep trying.

If you are anything like me,
You could not recognize the face of your love
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
Threw your victory flag away

Why She Disappeared Poem,misc,Taylor Swift,2017,385670,{},"When she fell, she fell apart.
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends

When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
""Whatever you say, it is not right.""
""Whatever you do, it is not enough.""
""Your kindness is fake.""
""Your pain is manipulative.""

When she lay there on the ground,
She dreamed of time machines and revenge
and a love that was really something,
Not just the idea of something.

When she finally rose, she rose slowly
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
Wary of phone calls and promises,
Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes
When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness
Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed
Standing broad-shouldered next to her
was a love that was really something,
not just the idea of something.

When she turned to go home,
She heard the echoes of new words
""May your heart remain breakable
But never by the same hand twice""
And even louder:
""without your past,
you could never have arrived-
so wondrously and brutally,
By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance
...here.""

 ""Whatever you say, it is not right."" 
 ""Whatever you do, it is not enough."" 
 ""Your kindness is fake."" 
 ""Your pain is manipulative."" 
 When she lay there on the ground, 
 She dreamed of time machines and revenge 
 and a love that was really something, 
 Not just the idea of something. 
 When she finally rose, she rose slowly 
 Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies 
 Wary of phone calls and promises, 
 Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes 
 When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness 
 Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck 
 Bathed in her brokenness 
 Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor 
 she never knew she needed 
 Standing broad-shouldered next to her 
 was a love that was really something, 
 not just the idea of something. 
 When she turned to go home, 
 She heard the echoes of new words 
 ""May your heart remain breakable 
 But never by the same hand twice"" 
 And even louder: 
 ""without your past, 
 you could never have arrived- 
 so wondrously and brutally, 
 By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance 
 ...here."" 
 And in the death of her reputation, 
 She felt truly alive.",Positive
The Trick to Holding On Poem,misc,Taylor Swift,2017,10582,{},"Let go of the ones who hurt you
Let go of the ones you outgrow
Let go of the words they hurl your way
as you’re walking out the door
The only thing cut and dry
In this hedge-maze life
Is the fact that their words will cut
but your tears will dry

They don’t tell you this when you are young
You can’t hold on to everything
Can’t show up for everyone
You pick your poison
Or your cure
Phone numbers you know by heart
And the ones you don’t answer any more

Hold on to the faint recognition in
the eye of a stranger
As it catches you in its lustrous net
How quickly we become intertwined
How wonderful it is to forget
All the times your intuition failed you
But it hasn’t killed you yet
Hold on to childlike whims and moonlight
swims and your blazing self-respect
And if you drive the roads of this town
Ones you’ve gone down so many times before
Flashback to all the times
Life nearly ran you off the road
But tonight your hand is steady
Suddenly you’ll know

Long Live/New Years Day,pop,Taylor Swift,2018,10452,{},"[Verse 1: Long Live]
I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus 1: Long Live]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
[Bridge 1: Long Live]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
And hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground

[Verse 2: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus 2: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you are lost and I am scared
And you are turning away
I want your midnights
But I shall be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 3: New Year's Day]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it has gonna be a long road
I shall be there if you are the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you are crawling home
[Chorus 3: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it has hard or it has wrong
Or we are making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I shall be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please, do not ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please, do not ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 4: New Year's Day]

Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

And you are turning away

I Bet You Think About Me Taylors Version From the Vault,country,Taylor Swift,2021,359778,"{""Chris Stapleton""}","[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
3 AM and I am still awake, I shall bet you are just fine
Fast asleep in your city that has better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I shall bet your friends tell you she has better than me, huh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I had not heard of

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we are done and it has over
I bet you could not believe
When you realized I am harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it was not a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills
[Verse 4: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
But you know what they say, you cannot help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we are too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I do not have to be your shrink to know that you shall never be happy
And I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'
""Why did you let her go?""
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you are lookin' for
Is the love that you had?

[Verse 5: Taylor Swift]
Now you are out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered because you were with me
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we are done and it has over

 Makin' that sign must have taken all night 
 You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace 
 And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate 
 'Cause shade never made anybody less gay 
 So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh 
 You need to calm down, you are being too loud 
 And I am just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh) 
 You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown? 
 You need to calm down 
 And we see you over there on the internet 
 Comparing all the girls who are killing it 
 But we figured you out 
 We all know now we all got crowns 
 You need to calm down

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you are right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you are right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I am always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What does not kill me makes me want you more

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I am not dying (Oh yeah, you are right, I want it)
We say that we will just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you are right, I want it)

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I have crossed unforgiven
I shall tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I do not wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I do not wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I have been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I have stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it has morning now
It's brighter now, now
[Chorus]
I do not wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I do not wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I have been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I am wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

[Bridge]
And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it has golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it has golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

[Chorus]
I do not wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I do not wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I have been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
(Now I am wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)

I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)
[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go

[Spoken Outro]
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things I am afraid of, I am afraid of

 I do not wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you

 And so I became the butt of the joke 
 I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked

Cornelia Street,pop,Taylor Swift,2019,710018,{},"[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I had never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I had never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I am so terrified of if you ever walk away
I had never walk Cornelia Street again
I had never walk Cornelia Street again

[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Oh, I had...

[Verse 1]
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that has not where mine lives

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)
[Verse 2]
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, do not threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

[Bridge]
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I am your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)
[Chorus]
You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking Soho
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet

So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it has not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you are not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
’Cause I cannot pretend it has okay when it has not
It's death by a thousand cuts
[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it shall be alright
They say, ""I do not know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?

Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand

 We might just get away with it 
 The altar is my hips 
 Even if it has a false god 
 We'd still worship this love 
 We’d still worship this love 
 We’d still worship this love 
 I know heaven's a thing 
 I go there when you touch me, honey 
 Hell is when I fight with you 
 But we can patch it up good 
 Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness 
 Got the wine for you 
 And you cannot talk to me when I am like this 
 Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you 
 You're the West Village 
 You still do it for me, babe 
 They all warned us about times like this 
 They say the road gets hard and you get lost 
 When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith 
 But we might just get away with it 
 Religion's in your lips 
 Even if it has a false god 
 We'd still worship 
 We might just get away with it 
 The altar is my hips 
 Even if it has a false god 
 We'd still worship this love 
 We'd still worship this love 
 We'd still worship this love, ah 
 Still worship this love 
 Even if it has a false god 
 Even if it has a false god 
 Still worship this love",Negative

Lover Foreword,misc,Taylor Swift,2019,12756,{},"When I found old diaries from my childhood and my teens, they were covered in dust. I am not just saying that for poetic effect, they were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits and inspirational quotes I used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful moments. I had practice my autograph and tape my guitar picks to the pages. In the entries, I daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the dance or how nervous I was saying the national anthem at the local baseball game. I frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love, friends, confidence and trust. I vented, described memories in detail, jotted down new song ideas and questioned why I would ever try to shoot for a career I had such a small chance of ever attaining.

But what shocked me the most was how often I wrote down the things I loved. Writing a new song, riding in the car with my mom, the purple-pink skies of the soccer field  on the walk home, the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting, the dazzle of opal necklaces I couldn’t afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case. I wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such... wonderment. Intrigue. Romance. I noticed things and decided they were romantic, and so they were.

In life, we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be, how to act, or how to be happy. Like invisible smoke in the room, we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life. We constantly question our choices, our surroundings, and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes. All the while, we crave romance. We long for those rare, enchanting moments when things just fall into place. Above all else, we really, really want our lives to be filled with love.

I have decided that in this life, I want to be defined by the things I love- not the things I hate, the things I am afraid of, or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. Those things may be struggles, but they are not my identity. I wish the same for you. May your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud, clear voices of those who love and appreciate you. Turn those voices up in the mix in your head. May you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them. May you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later, only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you... did not. I hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed. I hope that if there is a lover in your life, it has someone who deserves you. If that has the case, I hope you treat them with care.

This album is a love letter to love itself- all the captivating, spellbinding, maddening devastating red, blue, gray, golden aspects of it (that has why there are so many songs).
In honor of fever dreams, bad boys, confessions of love on a drunken night out, Christmas lights still hanging in January, guitar string scars on my hands, false gods and blind faith, memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool, creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light, finally finding a friend, and opening the curtains to see the clearest, brightest daylight after the darkest night.

We are what we love.

Follow me home if you dare to
I would not know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start

All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I shall never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again

And I know that this life is not safe, but it has wild and it has free

 Visions of dazzling rooms I shall never get let into 
 And the memories were lost long ago 
 But at least you have beautiful ghosts 
 And so maybe my home is not what I had known 
 What I thought it would be 
 But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night 
 And I know that this life is not safe, but it has wild and it has free 
 All that I wanted was to be wanted 
 I shall never wander London streets, alone and haunted 
 Born into nothing 
 With them, I have something, something to cling to 
 I never knew I had love this world they have let me into 
 And the memories were lost long ago 
 So I shall dance with these beautiful ghosts 
 And the memories were lost long ago 
 So I shall dance with these beautiful ghosts",Positive

Christmas Tree Farm,pop,Taylor Swift,2019,115287,{},"[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I am somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they are warm and they are safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

And everythin' is icy and blue

Macavity's a mystery cat, he has called the Hiddenpaw
For he has the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Macavity, Macavity, there has no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Macavity's a ginger cat, he has very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake
And when you think he has half asleep, he has always wide awake

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Macavity, Macavity, there has no one like Macavity
For he has a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there
[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
He's outwardly respectable, I know, he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing, Macavity's not there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Idris Elba & Both]
Macavity, Macavity, there has no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place, Macavity was not there
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime

Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you are out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

[Chorus]
And that has the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times

[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
[Chorus]
And that has the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me ""kid,"" do not call me ""baby""
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I cannot see with anyone else
Don't call me ""kid,"" do not call me ""baby""
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I cannot speak with anyone else

​the last great american dynasty,pop,Taylor Swift,2020,1169446,{},"[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud

It must have been her fault his heart gave out

""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could have been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could have been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen

They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

Folklore Foreword,misc,Taylor Swift,2020,12140,{},"It started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity

Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of ""let us run away"" and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate

Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I have never met, people I have known, or those I wish I had not. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that is not his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out

A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someone's secrets written in the sky for all to behold

In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I have told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve

Gray November
I have been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I could not be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Hey December
Guess I am feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause
On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed
[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I could not be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain, we will be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I am on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

But I do not, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

Oh, I cannot

 Now I am missing your smile, hear me out 
 We could just ride around 
 And the road not taken looks real good now 
 And it always leads to you and my hometown 
 Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake 
 I will not ask you to wait if you do not ask me to stay 
 So I shall go back to L.A. and the so-called friends 
 Who'll write books about me if I ever make it 
 And wonder about the only soul 
 Who can tell which smiles I am fakin' 
 And the heart I know I am breakin' is my own 
 To leave the warmest bed I have ever known 
 We could call it even 
 Even though I am leaving 
 And I shall be yours for the weekend 
 ​'Tis the damn season 
 We could call it even 
 You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend 
 ​'Tis the damn season, write this down 
 I am stayin' at my parents' house 
 And the road not taken looks real good now 
 Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires 
 Now I am missing your smile, hear me out 
 We could just ride around 
 And the road not taken looks real good now 
 And it always leads to you and my hometown

Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, ""That am not my Merlot on his mouth
That am not my jewelry on our joint account""
No, there am not no doubt
I think I am gonna call him out

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
She says, ""I think he did it, but I just cannot prove it""
I think he did it, but I just cannot prove it
I think he did it, but I just cannot prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I am not lettin' up until the day I die

No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Este was not there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there am not no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, because

And I have cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me

Honey, when I am above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I am right down in it, all the years I have given
Is just shit we are dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I cannot face reinvention
I have not met the new me yet

[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would have loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she shall be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I did not mean that
Sorry, I cannot see facts through all of my fury
You have not met the new me yet

But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe

Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind

I cannot make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it has the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too
[Verse 3]
Honey, when I am above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You have not met the new me yet

And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break

Right down the rabbit hole

Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips

At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door

But if someone comes at us, this time, I am ready

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you am not seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I have not seen you around before""

'Cause when you are fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you are fifteen, feelin' like there has nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in

At fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you are best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they are so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And you are feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you are thinkin' he has the one
And you are dancin' 'round your room when the night ends

Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

And you just might find who you are supposed to be

And all my single friends are jealous

I could not ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, ""You look beautiful tonight""
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it has 2AM and I am cursing your name

And that has the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone

And I never knew I could feel that much
And that has the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I am comfortable

The Best Day Taylors Version,country,Taylor Swift,2021,20845,{},"[Verse 1]
I am five years old, it has getting cold, I have got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[Chorus]
I do not know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you are not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Verse 2]
I am thirteen now
And do not know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I have forgotten all their names

[Chorus]
I do not know who I am going to talk to now at school
But I know I am laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it has going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you are talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
Daddy's smart
And you are the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

 I shall leave my window open 
 'Cause I am too tired at night to call your name 
 Just know I am right here hoping 
 That you shall come in with the rain 
 I could stand up and sing you a song 
 But I do not wanna have to go that far 
 And I, I have got you down, I know you by heart 
 And you do not even know where I start 
 Talk to yourself, talk to the tears 
 Talk to the man who put you here 
 And do not wait for the sky to clear 
 I shall leave my window open

 When I still see it all in my head 
 In burning red 
 Burning, it was red 
 Oh, losing him was blue like I had never known 
 Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa) 
 Forgetting him was like 
 Trying to know somebody you never met 
 'Cause loving him was red

Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I am not fine at all

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Taylors Version,pop,Taylor Swift,2021,28219,{},"[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I have had enough,"" because like
We had not seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I am gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

Holy Ground Taylors Version,pop,Taylor Swift,2021,40131,{},"[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we had made
And that was the first day

And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
Wе block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""
And for thе first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

New to town with a made-up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream

The Moment I Knew Taylors Version,pop,Taylor Swift,2021,44214,{},"[Verse 1]
You should have been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I am right here"" smile
And it would have felt like
A million little shining stars that just align
And I would have been so happy

[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I have got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I have been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you had be here
You said you had be here

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they are all laughing
As I am looking around the room
But therе was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knеw
[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there has something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he had be here""

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they are all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do

Is the one who did not show?

Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

Spinning faster than the plane that took you

Better Man Taylors Version From the Vault,country,Taylor Swift,2021,323950,{},"[Verse 1]
I know I am probably better off on my own
Than lovin’ a man who did not know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

Forever Winter Taylors Version From the Vault,country,Taylor Swift,2021,252641,{},"[Verse 1]
He says he does not believe anything much he hears these days
He says, ""Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?""
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity

[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 3 AM, pacing
He says, ""It's not just a phase I am in""
My voice comes out begging

[Chorus]
All this time I did not know
You were breaking down
I had fall to pieces on the floor
If you were not around
Too young to know it gets better
I shall be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
[Verse 2]
He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, it has hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he shall decide to leave instead

[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 5 AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming

All this time I did not know

If you were not around
Too young to know it gets better
I shall be summer sun for you forever

I had take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I had say I love you even at your darkest and
Please do not go

Give me the keys, I shall bring the car back around

I had drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and do not say no, no

""I shall wait for you""

Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we will run
Ooh, we will run

So you laugh like a child
And I shall sing like no one cares

I wish I could fly

[Verse 1]
And so it goes
Every weekend, the same party
I never go alone
And I do not seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I am going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you

But we did like children running
Back then, we did not know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each other's hearts

 I was ridin' in the car when we both fell 
 I am the one on the phone as you whisper 
 ""Do you know how much I miss you?"" 
 I wish that we could go back in time 
 And I had say to you 
 ""I miss you like it was the very first night"" 
 I wish I could fly 
 I had pick you up and we had go back in time 
 I had write this in the sky 
 I miss you like it was the very first night 
 Take me away 
 Take me away 
 Take me away 
 To you, to you 
 Take me away 
 Take me away 
 Take me away

All Too Well 10 Minute Version Taylors Version From the Vault,pop,Taylor Swift,2021,2713579,{},"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you hav still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it has long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I am not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red because you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it has love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it has the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it has long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we had swear
To remember it all too well, yeah
[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I am a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I am in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you are on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time will not fly, it has like I am paralyzed by it
I had like to be my old self again, but I am still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cannot get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you hav ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I shall get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I am a soldier who has returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?

State Of Grace Acoustic Version Taylors Version,pop,Taylor Swift,2021,18040,{},"[Verse 1]
I am walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

And I never saw you comin'
And I shall never be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean

All Too Well 10 Minute Version Taylors Version Live Acoustic,pop,Taylor Swift,2021,1808788,{},"[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you hav still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it has long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I am not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red because you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""fuck the patriarchy""
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it has love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it has the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it has long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we had swear
To remember it all too well, yeah
[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I am a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I am in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you are on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""
[Verse 5]
Time will not fly, it has like I am paralyzed by it
I had like to be my old self again, but I am still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cannot get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you hav ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 6]
And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes
""I shall get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I am a soldier who has returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well

 I remember it all too well 
 And there we are again when nobody had to know 
 You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath 
 Sacred prayer and we had swear 
 To remember it all too well, oh-oh-oh-oh 
 And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much 
 Maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up 
 Runnin' scared, I was there 
 I remember it all too well 
 And you call me up again just to break me like a promise 
 So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest 
 I am a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here 
 'Cause I remember it all, all, all 
 They say all's well that ends well, but I am in a new hell 
 Every time you double-cross my mind 
 You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would have been fine 
 And that made me want to die 
 The idea you had of me, who was she? 
 A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you 
 Not weepin' in a party bathroom 
 Some actress askin' me what happened, you 
 That's what happened, you 
 You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes 
 Sippin' coffee like you are on a late-night show 
 But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come 
 And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"" 
 Time will not fly, it has like I am paralyzed by it 
 I had like to be my old self again, but I am still tryin' to find it 
 After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own 
 Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone 
 But you keep my old scarf from that very first week 
 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me 
 You cannot get rid of it 
 'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah 
 'Cause there we are again when I loved you so 
 Back before you lost the one real thing you hav ever known 
 It was rare, I was there 
 I remember it all too well 
 Wind in my hair, you were there 
 You remember it all 
 Down the stairs, you were there 
 You remember it all 
 It was rare, I was there 
 I remember it all too well 
 And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes 
 ""I shall get older, but your lovers stay my age"" 
 From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones 
 I am a soldier who has returning half her weight 
 And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue? 
 Just between us, did the love affair maim you too? 
 'Cause in this city's barren cold 
 I still remember the first fall of snow 
 And how it glistened as it fell 
 I remember it all too well 
 Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well? 
 Just between us, do you remember it all too well? 
 Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well 
 Just between us, I remember it 
 Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there) 
 Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there) 
 Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there 
 It was rare, you remember it all too well 
 Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there 
 Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there) 
 Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there 
 It was rare, you remember it (All too well) 
 Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh) 
 Down the stairs, I was there, I was there 
 Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there 
 It was rare, you remember it",Positive
